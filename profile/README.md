### ****Description****

On-chain Oracles are limited by their ability to scale, particularly on Ethereum. They are relatively inaccessible, bottlenecked by engineering teams, and, most notably, they lack transparency and true decentralization. Deploying a proprietary solution, Chronicle Protocol solves all of these limitations. 

Chronicle Protocol is redefining ubiquitous access to verifiable data. Users can deploy Oracles and call for updated data at the click of a button, verify where every element of data has come from using the Chronicle Explorer, and plug and play with any blockchain in a self-serve, decentralized framework. 

Since 2017, Chronicle has secured over $10B for DeFi’s largest lending protocol, MakerDAO. And now, for the first time, Chronicle’s market-leading features are available to all Web3 builders anytime, anywhere.
