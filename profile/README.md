### ****Description****

Oracles are integral to the transmission of data on-chain, facilitating the cutting-edge of decentralized finance, yet Oracle innovation has, comparatively, progressed very little.


On-chain Oracles are limited by their ability to scale, particularly on Ethereum. They are relatively inaccessible, bottlenecked by engineering teams, and, most notably, they lack transparency and true decentralization. Deploying a proprietary solution, Chronicle Protocol alleviates many of these limitations.


Chronicle Protocol is redefining access to cost-efficient and verifiable data. Users can subscribe and unsubscribe to Oracles on-demand, call for updated data at the click of a button, verify where every element of data has come from in an uncensorable environment, and plug and play with any supported blockchain via the self-serve, decentralized Dashboard.


Since 2017, Chronicle has secured over $10B for DeFiâ€™s largest lending protocol, MakerDAO. And now, for the first time, Chronicleâ€™s market-leading features are available to all Web3 builders anytime, anywhere.
